Well, hello there.

I finally got around to setting up this website. Setting up a personal blog ground up was something that I have been planning to do for a while (and I couldn't live with the guilt of having paid for a domain any more.)

My name is Divyansh, and I am a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft. I live in Bellevue, WA and I'm dreading the upcoming Seattle winters.
