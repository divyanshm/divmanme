Nothing says introduction to a blog better than the tech that is powering it. Also, to be honest, I'd like to document how I set up this website/blog just in case I need to come back to this.

The initial set-up here included, 
1. An Azure subscription - this is something that we get as FTE's. The idea was to set up a website without spending any additional amount of money (other than what's already spent).
2. A domain name - I logged in to godaddy.com and purchased a domain name for myself - this is something that for some reason I had been wanting to do for quite some time.

Now, coming to the website set-up I looked around on the internet on how to best set up a static website/blog on Azure and came across [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo) useful article that spoke about setting up a blog using Hugo as the website generator. Well, the problem here is that while I do love technology, I suck at web designing (eg. html, css, js, react etc).

The setup was quite easy, and the cool integration with GitHub actions made it very easy to just incrementally push some changes and see them live on the internet. I must say I'm impressed with Hugo as well as it makes it so convenient to test any changes on my machine. 

I do hope now, that I continue to add more content here as I had been wanting to do for such a long time.
